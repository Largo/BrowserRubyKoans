# Ruby Koans online with Ruby.wasm


"The Ruby Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn Ruby. The goal is to learn the Ruby language, syntax, structure, and some common functions and libraries." - [RubyKoans.com](https://rubykoans.com)

## About ruby.wasm

[See the following on how to get started with Ruby.wasm](https://github.com/Largo/ruby.wasm-quickstart)
This project uses my fork and changes on Ruby.wasm. Mostly improvements to the JS Bridge, which allow us to use the WebAPI in manner natural to rubyists. I implemented  dot syntax for accessing JavaScript objects and conversions from JavaScript objects to Ruby objects.
