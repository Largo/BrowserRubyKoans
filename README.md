# Ruby Koans online with Ruby.wasm


[See the following on how to get started with Ruby.wasm](https://github.com/Largo/ruby.wasm-quickstart)
This project uses my fork and changes on Ruby.wasm. Mostly improvements to the JS Bridge, which allow us to use the WebAPI in manner natural to rubyists. I implemented  dot syntax for accessing JavaScript objects and conversions from JavaScript objects to Ruby objects.
